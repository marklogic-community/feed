<description><![CDATA[<p>Two more movies on my horizon, both about outsiders in the music business:</p>
<ul>
<li>The trailer for Young @ Heart that nearly brought me to tears last night can't yet be found online, and the <a href="http://www.channel4.com/more4/documentaries/doc-feature.jsp?id=102">clip available at Channel4</a>, where the film originally aired in the UK is a bit dry.  Instead, you'll find <a href="http://www.thedocumentaryblog.com/index.php/2007/07/05/young-heart-documentary-acquired-by-fox-searchlight/">info on the film and two great clips at The Documentary Blog</a>, including a heart-wrenching performance of the Young @ Heart chorus of elderly people (average age 80) performing Coldplay</a>, part of a repertoire including The Clash, The Ramones, and Sonic Youth.</li>
<li>Great World of Sound is an Altmanesque comedy about two normal southern guys who get caught up in a record industry talent scout scheme.  <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/magnolia/greatworldofsound/trailer/">The trailer at Apple</a> looks promising.</li>

<title>● VHS gets love from two upcoming movies</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Most avid readers will speak to an emotional attachment to books through associations of the senses - the roughness of the page, the smell of ink and glue - when describing a love of reading.  Filmmakers and connoisseurs of film will cite an obsession with the physical properties of the celluloid through which movies are projected.</p>

<p>But for a generation of filmmakers who cut their filmmaker teeth by shooting with the family camcorder and editing with two VCRs, there is a logical fixation with the object of the plastic and magnetic 1/2" VHS videocassette and the visual artifacts of its recorded image.</p>

<p>Two movies will be released in the next months which hold the VHS aesthetic dear.  One is Michel Gondry's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0799934/">Be Kind Rewind</a> in which two video store clerks decide to deal with a store full of accidentally erased tapes by remaking the classic movies in their own, VHS homebrew fashion.</p>

<p>The other paean to VHS is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0845046/">Son of Rambow</a>, Garth Jennings' film which was the darling of Sundance this year.  The title is that of the homebrewed movie that two little boys make after discovering and being mindblown by a bootleg copy of Rambo: First Blood on VHS.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/newline/bekindrewind/">Trailer for Be Kind Rewind</a>.</p>

<p>No trailer yet for Son of Rambow, but <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/382543/Son-of-Rambow/overview">a review from The New York Times</a>.</p>

<p>This begs the question: with Super-8 and VHS all but a distant memory, with MiniDV on the way to extinction, what formats will the future filmmakers obsess over and what artifacts will they attempt to reproduce for nostalgia as they grow up and the formats of their youth are phased out?</p>]]> <![CDATA[ (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/07/12/vhs-gets-love-from-two-upcoming-movies">Comment on this</a>)]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>For the first time since the 1998 creation of the Siemens Competition in Math, Science and Technology, the top honors have gone to girls.  One of the two projects to take the $100,000 prize was the creation of a molecule to help block drug-resistant tuberculosis bacteria from reproducing.  The other studied the bone growth in zebra fish.</p>

<p>Interesting tidbits:  Three-quarters of the finalists have at least one parent who is a scientist.  Girls outnumbered boys in the final round for the first time.  Most of the finalists were from public schools.  The most popular project was from three home-schooled girls who have conceived of a Burgercam, a system for monitoring the elimination of E. coli bacteria in burgers.

<title>Tucked in among The Kinks, The Velvet Underground and Belle &amp;...</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Tucked in among The Kinks, The Velvet Underground and Belle & Sebastian, the track behind the animated opening title sequence for the new movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467406/">Juno</a> is All I Want is You by the children's folk musician <a href="http://www.barrylou.com/originalCDs.html">Barry Louis Polisar</a>.  It's as inspired a choice for this enjoyable little movie as PT Anderson's inclusion on the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272338/">Punch Drunk Love</a> soundtrack of <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=212910613&s=143441&i=212910705">He Needs Me (iTunes link)</a>, Olive Oyl's love song from Robert Altman's 1980 adaptation of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081353/">Popeye</a>.</p>

<p>Polisar was a favorite of mine as a kid.  In particular, the 1978 album Naughty Songs for Boys and Girls was my undisputed favorite record.  Featuring the classics Don't Put Your Finger Up Your Nose and Never Cook Your Sister in a Frying Pan, the album has never gone out of print.  <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=3988409&s=143441">Give the tracks a listen on iTunes</a> and if you have kids, this will give them lots of laughs and teach them to rebell against their parents.</p>

<p><a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/movies/05juno.html?ref=movies">The New York Times has a review of Juno here</a>.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000JJ14/ref=nosim/0sil8">Amazon link to Naughty Songs for Boys and Girls here</a>.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> My favorite funnyblogger Todd Levin <a href="http://www.tremble.com/000656.html">chimes in on the Juno soundtrack at tremble.com</a>.</p>

-Harry Partch</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/arts/music/06part.html?ex=1354597200&en=ef00427b4d30882a&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss">The Japan Society in New York is currently staging &#34;Delusion of the Fury,&#34; the best-known work of Harry Partch.</a>  Partch was a pioneer of microtonal music who began modifying conventional instruments, then eventually manufacturing his own instruments in order to write music that conventional instruments couldn't play.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOHBqFevy0k">In this video from 1968, he is seen playing an instrument of his creation, the harmonic canon.</a></p>

<p><b>Update:</b> Ben Tesch, who launched the collaborative weather site <a href="http://www.cumul.us/">cumul.us</a> in October, also developed <a href="http://musicmavericks.publicradio.org/features/feature_partch.html#">a site for American Mavericks in honor of Harry Partch and his music</a>.  The site allows you to play virtual recreations of a large selection of Partch's instruments.

<description><![CDATA[<p>Alec Baldwin must relish the opportunity to channel his rage through Jack Donaghy, the beloved heartless media executive he plays on 30 Rock, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alec-baldwin/the-buyers-long-term-pla_b_75298.html">a rage in evidence at The Huffington Post in his open-skewering of the suits who own and run his show's network.</a></p>

<p>On the problem of the studios in the ongoing WGA negotiations&#58;</p>

<blockquote><p>They are owned by huge, creativity-deadening corporations and operated by lawyers and marketing executives who lord over the worst creative decline I have witnessed in a long time, particularly in films. In television, companies like GE view properties like NBC the way realtors view square footage. GE does not care what is on NBC. So long as the programming is relatively inoffensive, they want to earn as much per square foot as they can.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the time it was just a whimsical sound bite, but these new images make me head-splittingly happy, enough to buy all the way in to the pancake love. (thx joseph)</p>

I had tickets reserved for tonight's taping that <i>definitely</i> would have been used if if I'd been able to reconcile my preteen nostalgia with the potentially many hours of sitting in a studio and cheering on cue.</p>

<p>Instead, I set out to learn the Gladiator names of other American Gladiators around the world.</p>

<li>Sweden's American Gladiators battle it out on Gladiatorerna.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vau2RJqP94w">In this clip, Phoenix and Raptor manhandle the Attackboll</a>.  With cheerleaders and minimalist on-screen graphics.</li>
<li>American Gladiators in South Africa are known as MTN Gladiators.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KHhicJx6bc">Watch Gazelle live up to her name on the Pendulum</a>.  With pleasant accents and everyone smiles and is very cordial to one another.</li>
<li>American Gladiators in 1991 go by the name American Gladiators, featuring Malibu, Zap, Lace, and all the rest.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGDwScgb_Y0">I could not find a third international American Gladiator clip</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you were to pit Gladiator teams from around the world against each other in one arena, make it part of the penal system and introduce a fat, homicidal tenor named <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093894/">Dynamo</a> to the fray, now <i>that's</i> a taping I would go to.</p>]]><![CDATA[ (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/07/12/14602.html">link</a>)]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.colormatters.com/color_trademark.html">Color Matters</a> examines four legal battles over color trademark infringement in packaging and branding, each decided by a test of &#34;color functionality.&#34;</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. courts denied Ambrit's request for protection of blue, on the basis that royal blue when used to package frozen desserts was functional and could not be monopolized in a trademark. The ruling stated &#34;Royal blue is a &#39;cool color;&#39; it is suggestive of coldness and used by a multitude of ice cream and frozen dessert producers.&#34; Although the ruling acknowledged the issue of protecting the consumer from confusion, preventing a monopoly of a functional color was a greater issue.</p></blockquote>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Regarding the theory that kids are set up for disappointment and failure later in life when they value their innate gifts too highly over their ability to grow, <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-secret-to-raising-smart-kids&print=true">this Scientific American article</a> claims that the key to developing a child's potential is teaching the child that the greatest reward comes from effort, not intelligence or ability.</p>

<blockquote><p>The students who held a fixed mind-set, however, were concerned about looking smart with little regard for learning. They had negative views of effort, believing that having to work hard at something was a sign of low ability. They thought that a person with talent or intelligence did not need to work hard to do well. Attributing a bad grade to their own lack of ability, those with a fixed mind-set said that they would study less in the future, try never to take that subject again and consider cheating on future tests.</p></blockquote>

<title>● Remembrance of Phones Past</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I once went through a painful, protracted breakup, conducted almost entirely over <a href="http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/phone.php?p=153">this LG phone</a>.  It wasn't a bad phone, but to this day, even a picture of it is like a punch to the gut - its Major-thirds ringtone, the wallpaper mocking my heartache with its cheery blue sky.  I feel a little nauseous even describing it (my description may just be nauseating, in fairness).</p>

<p>In 2001, I spoke to my father on <a href="http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/phone.php?p=10">this Kyocera smartphone</a> from 8th Avenue, having run up the block from work just in time to see the first tower fall.  I don't have to go into all the emotional baggage which that implies.</p>

<p>Now, in my current phase, I probably don't have enough perspective to characterize what of me is reflected in my current phone, but I think that in a while, I'll have an idea.</p>

<p>Since the time began that we were never to be found without our mobile phones (or whichever portable devices, for that matter), I feel that somehow all of the memories of the current chapter of my life are being constantly averaged out and inextricably linked to the phone that I'm using.</p>

<p>Do you have any similar experiences to share?  Do you think that linking my identity to my gadgets entails a sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphism</a>?  What do you think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_Memory">Proust</a> would have to say about all this?  (I've never read Proust, so I'm honestly asking.)  Other insightful references to prior discussions or great thinkers would be helpful as well.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> Michael Leddy at <a href="http://mleddy.blogspot.com/2007/12/proust-on-objects-and-their.html">orange crate art</a> has been mining his Proust and has turned up an incredibly relevant passage to the discussion:<br />
<blockquote><p>...a thing which we have looked at long ago, if we see it again, brings back to us, along with our original gaze, all the images which that gaze contained. This is because things &#45;&#45; a book in its red binding, like the rest &#45;&#45; at the moment we notice them, turn within us into something immaterial, akin to all the preoccupations or sensations we have at that particular time, and mingle indissolubly with them.</p><p>-Marcel Proust, <i>Finding Time Again</i></p></blockquote></p>]]> <![CDATA[ (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/07/12/remembrance-of-phones-past">Comment on this</a>)]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>At long last, Apple is listed as one of the available brands of camera in the <a href="http://flickr.com/cameras/apple/">flickr Camera Finder</a>.</p>

<p>This means that you can search for shots taken not only with <a href="http://flickr.com/cameras/apple/iphone/">iPhone</a>, but with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicktake">the three models of Apple's original camera line, the QuickTake</a> (codenamed <i>Venus, Mars, and Neptune</i>).  Currently, there are no viewable uploaded photos taken with the QuickTake 100 or 150, but <a href="http://flickr.com/cameras/apple/quicktake_200/">there are some from the QuickTake 200</a>.</p>

<p>It's also nice to see that <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/merlin/1973913321/">Merlin's tree.cx pic</a> made it to the top of the iPhone-taken &#39;interesting&#39; list. (via <a href="http://highindustrial.tumblr.com/post/20844008">highindustrial</a>)</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> A potential reason for the iPhone's relatively paltry numbers is that when you email photos from the phone, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/takenwithiphone/discuss/72157600560131159/">it strips the exif data</a> out which means those photos aren't counted. I imagine many more people email photos to Flickr from the iPhone than upload them from their computers.</p>]]><![CDATA[ (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/07/12/14594.html">link</a>)]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Ridley Scott and the company behind "The Devil Wears Prada" will bring the epic story of the Gucci dynasty to the screen.  From <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117976891.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&query=gucci+film">Variety</a>:

<blockquote><p>Just when Maurizio [Gucci] was on the verge of his greatest success -- a daring fashion show debuting the clothes of newcomer Tom Ford -- his penchant for accumulating enemies caught up with him; Maurizio was gunned down in front of his Milan apartment in 1995.</p></blockquote>

<p>Plenty of potential for intrigue in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gucci#History_of_the_Gucci">history of the House of Gucci</a> in the 1970s and 80s, fleshed out by what is sure to be extravagant production design mixed with Scott's highly-stylized aesthetic will make this an interesting project to look out for.</p>

<p>Previous big screen forays into the world of high fashion include this year's vanity documentary <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0809439/">"Lagerfeld Confidential"</a> and the maligned Robert Altman romp <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110907/">"Pr&#234;t-&#224;-Porter (1994)."</a>  (via <a href="http://ttsmag.com/2007/12/04/gucci-film/">The Tastemakers Society</a>)</p>]]><![CDATA[ (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/07/12/14589.html">link</a>)]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Over at <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/009682.html">Making Light</a>, Avram Grumer has kicked off a fascinating discussion from yesterday's <a href="http://www.kottke.org/07/12/brawndos-got-what-plants-crave-now-so-can-you">Brawndo post here at kottke.org</a>.</p>

<p>Avram notes that the introduction of a product to the real world based on one from the fictional world is nothing new, citing Holiday Inn hotel and Bubba Gump restaurant chains as examples.  While he's coined the term "tl&#246;nian" for this phenomenon, based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tlon">Borges story "Tl&#246;n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius,"</a>  a commenter suggests "defictionalization," a Google search of which currently places the Making Light discussion as the #2 result, so I'm thinking it has staying power.</p>

<p>Other notable examples of defictionalization: the <a href="http://www.techcomedy.com/www.redswinglinestapler.com/">Red Swingline stapler</a> from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/">"Office Space" (1999)</a> (another Mike Judge movie!), the Buzz Rickson's MA-1, made in black only after William Gibson wrote it that way in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0425198685/ref=nosim/0sil8">"Pattern Recognition,"</a> and of course, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_Tap">Spinal Tap</a>.</p>  

<p>A Tap-related <a href="http://lastexittonowhere.com/tshirt/013/">Polymer Records t-shirt is available at Last Exit To Nowhere</a>, where fine defictionalized goods are sold.  I'd wear it just to channel Paul Schaffer's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0008529/">Artie Fufkin</a> as frequently as possible.</p>

<p>And to the snackfood and energy bar manufacturers out there: who among you has the temerity to sell me some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soylent_green">Soylent Green</a>?</p>]]><![CDATA[ (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/07/12/14588.html">link</a>)]]></description>

<title>● On Twitter as a Rude Metaphor</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>"People say, You must have been the class clown. And I say, No, I wasn't. <i>But I sat next to the class clown, and I studied him.</i>"<br />
- <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0015711/">Dr. Allan Pearl</a></p>

<p>This is why I love my Twitter: it fulfills in me a primal urge to act out in class, in little bursts.  Since having moved past school and into the working world, the class clowning urge was one I'd kept dormant.  As it turns out, however, blurting out ridiculous things to a roomful of people offers every bit the dopamine jolt as an adult as it did as a kid, which turns out to be very therapeutic.  </p>

<p>In Twitter, there is a sense of ordered play.  There is no judgement.  You can talk to your neighbors, stand up and give a report on what you're doing, pass notes, make fart noises if that's your schtick (the highest form of comedy), or sit in the back, observing.  But if you do a real banger mouthfart, like where your arm gets all wet and people actually think they smell something, there's the joy of peer approval, in the form of a "favorite."</p>

<p>Oh, and an added benefit of Twitter: it helps you to develop an economy of words and conciseness of ideas.  Because the longest mouthfart isn't always the funniest one.</p>]]></description>

<title>● Roberto Carlos, O Rei (The King)</title>
<description><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Influenced by his idol, Elvis Presley and the 1950s rock revolution, he rose to stardom as the main figure of the 60s musical movement known as Jovem Guarda (Young guard, in opposition to the 'old guard' of Brazilian music), which was the first manifestation of the Brazilian pop rock movement.</p><p>- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Carlos_%28singer%29">wikipedia</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In 1966 Brazil, this man was bigger than the Beatles.</p>

<title>● LA Transit to get in on some of that turnstile cash</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-gates30nov30,1,5410718.story?ctrack=1&cset=true">LA Times reports on the Transportation Authority's decision</a> to forgo the honor system for passenger ticket-taking in hopes of earning what they estimate to be $5.5 million annually on the 5% of riders who ride without paying.  The cost of installing 275 turnstiles, as proposed by the MTA, would be $30 million in installation and $1 million in annual maintenance.</p>

<blockquote><p>The move would be a major cultural shift for L.A.'s rail system, which was designed to have a more open feel than those in eastern cities, with their gates, turnstiles and barriers.</p></blockquote>

<p>I have to admit, I know of LA's rail system only anecdotally at this point.  For I, like most residents of Los Angeles, rely on my car for the daily commute.  My own is particularly brutal, which, from East LA to the coast in Santa Monica, means an hour of road time each way.  When a solution exists that doesn't <a href="http://www.ihateyoumetrorail.com/">fall far short of riders' expectations</a>, I'll be ready and eager to ditch my car.</p>

<p>If you've never seen the LA Metro before or didn't know it existed, there is some <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?s=int&w=all&q=metro+los+angeles&m=text">fantastic evidence to be found on flickr</a>.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Epic Records/Legacy Recordings is releasing a 25th Anniversary Special Edition of Michael Jackson's "Thriller," with bonus tracks including remixes by Akon, will.i.am, and Kanye West.</p>

<p>There's a nice <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16782751">interview on NPR with Chris Connelly</a>, who reviewed the album for Rolling Stone in 1982.</p>

<p>An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Music_album_record_thriller.jpg">alternate album cover</a> for the original Special Edition of "Thriller" can be found on wikipedia, for a look at what could have been.</p>]]></description>

<title>● Wailing Pull Stars of Super Mario Galaxy</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The latest installment of Super Mario has received plenty of <a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/07/11/14548.html">notice</a> for its revolutionary style of gameplay.  But just as striking is the intricacy of its sound design.  One convention of the game is a Pull Star, a floating anchor that Mario can grab with some sort of magical, musical force which, when activated emits a creepy, almost theremin-like wail, wavering just a bit before solemnly sliding down in pitch.  This sound is one of those elemental formulas for touching an emotional soft spot.  The other day I was playing a level with a series of Pull Stars in succession and my girlfriend implored me to stop, as it was making her sad, and not only because I'm a grown man playing a child's video game.  Here is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p9KZ0NMJNU">an example of the Wailing Pull Star</a> (and a taste of the very Vangelis-like score scattered throughout the game).</p>

<p>Also: via <a href="http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2007/11/19/video-recording-supe.html">Boing Boing Gadgets</a>, footage from a live orchestra scoring session for the game.  Mario's creator, Shigeru Miyamoto sits aside and supervises.</p>

<p>Also also: I noticed that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9ebI7JXPEk">the menu</a> for selecting levels to play is a musical instrument in its own right, allowing the player to create melody with chord changes and everything.  It's a subtle touch.</p>]]></description>

<title>● Indie hero Tom DiCillo asks Roger Ebert why his movie failed</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>After his last movie, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412637/">"Delirious"</a> brought in only $200,000 at the box office, a dejected Tom DiCillo, "a legend in the indie film world" reached out to <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071129/COMMENTARY/71129003">Roger Ebert</a> for answers.</p>

<blockquote><p>"To give you some indication of how disoriented I feel at the moment," he wrote, "I am getting no real, tangible feedback from anyone. And so I'm kind of struggling on my own to make sense of how a film I put my soul into, that Buscemi put his soul into, a film that generated such strong, positive reviews, had no life in the market."</p></blockquote>

<p>Ebert's most telling response was to the question of whether independent filmmakers have any chance of surviving this opening-weekend-takes-all era of distribution.  "I don't know. Maybe DVDs and Netflix and Blockbuster on Demand and cable TV and pay-per-view and especially high-quality streaming on the Internet will rescue you and your fellow independents."</p>

<p>While waiting for the release of "Delirious" to video, I recommend another of DiCillo's movies, the delicious <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115738/">"Box of Moonlight" (1996)</a>.</p>
